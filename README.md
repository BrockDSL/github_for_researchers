# Github for Researchers



## What

This interactive workshop ([PPT](https://github.com/BrockDSL/github_for_researchers/blob/master/Overview.pptx?raw=true)) will teach you the basics of how to interact with Github as if you were a researcher looking to share a research project. 



It follows a scenario that goes through a few stages:

1. Hosting code and data with Github ([PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrockDSL/github_for_researchers/master/p1.pdf
))
2. Interacting with a collaborator that makes a change to your code ([PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrockDSL/github_for_researchers/master/p2.pdf
))
3. Turning your repository into a webpage to showcase your work ([PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrockDSL/github_for_researchers/master/p3.pdf
))
4. Adding more data that you've collected to your repository ([PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrockDSL/github_for_researchers/master/p4.pdf
))
5. Adding a simple action to your repository ([PDF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrockDSL/github_for_researchers/master/p5.pdf
))

## Prerequisites
The only thing you'll need for the session is an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/join). We'll be just using the web interface, so no extra software needs to be installed.

## A Final word

Github is a very sophisticated tool, capable of quite a lot, this workshop is perfect for beginners who have never used it before. We will explore the tip of the iceberg in the workshop.
